# Dave Pack Portfolio

Built with Gatsby and React Native Web.

This was built rather quickly and needs some refactoring, not to mention UI/UX improvements. However, I'm proud of it! The animations use the React Native Animated api available in React Native Web.

## Install

Clone this repository and checkout the `source` branch.

Make sure you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:

```sh
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

And run from the project root:

```sh
gatsby develop
```

## Planned improvements

* [ ] Responsive card when project is being viewed.
* [ ] Responsive card animations (card moves to correct location after window resize).
* [ ] Improve card information layout and style.
* [ ] Better close button on card.
* [ ] Add a section to project info for describing dev/design process.
* [ ] Refactor animations code.
