It analyzes\n\t * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n\t * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n\t * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n\t *\n\t * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n\t * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n\t * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n\t *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n\t *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n\t *\n\t * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n\t * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n\t * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n\t * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n\t * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n\t * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n\t * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n\t * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n\t *\n\t * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n\t * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n\t *\n\t * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n\t *\n\t *   getInitialState: function() {\n\t *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n\t *   }\n\t *\n\t * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n\t *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n\t *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n\t *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n\t *\n\t *   // In render function:\n\t *   return (\n\t *     <View\n\t *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n\t *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n\t *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n\t *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n\t *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n\t *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n\t *       <View>\n\t *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n\t *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n\t *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n\t *       </View>\n\t *     </View>\n\t *   );\n\t *\n\t * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n\t *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n\t *\n\t * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n\t *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n\t *   that you should implement.\n\t *\n\t *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n\t *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n\t *   },\n\t *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n\t *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n\t *   },\n\t *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n\t *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n\t *   },\n\t *\n\t * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n\t *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n\t *     return 20;\n\t *   }\n\t *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n\t *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n\t *     return {top: 20, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 100};\n\t *   }\n\t */\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Touchable states.\n\t */\n\tvar States = {\n\t  NOT_RESPONDER: 'NOT_RESPONDER', // Not the

The only way\n\t * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n\t * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n\t *\n\t * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n\t * necessary\n\t *\n\t * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n\t * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n\t * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n\t * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n\t *\n\t * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n\t * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n\t * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n\t * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n\t * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n\t * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n\t * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n\t * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n\t * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n\t * events.\n\t *\n\t * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n\t *\n\t * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n\t *\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n\t *\n\t * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n\t * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n\t * for the dismissal of the keyboard.

It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *     return {top: 20, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 100};\n *   }\n */\n\n/**\n * Touchable states.\n */\nvar States = {\n  NOT_RESPONDER: 'NOT_RESPONDER', // Not the responder\n

The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\n * keyboard could be dismissed.\n *\n *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide\n */\n\nvar emptyObject = {}; /**\n                       * Copyright (c) 2016-present, Nicolas Gallagher.\n                       * Copyright (c) 2015-present, Facebook, Inc.\n                       *\n                       * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\n                       * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\n                       *\n                       * \n                       */\n\nvar IS_ANIMATING_TOUCH_START_THRESHOLD_MS = 16;\n\nvar ScrollResponderMixin = {\n  // mixins: [Subscribable.Mixin],\n  scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState: function scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState() {\n    return {\n      isTouching: false,\n      lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: 0,\n      lastMomentumScrollEndTime: 0,\n\n      // Reset to false every time becomes responder.
